Absolutely, Vishnu. Here are five basic questions about Angular along with concise answers, suitable for someone with a fundamental understanding of the framework:

**1. What is Angular and what makes it different from AngularJS?**
   - **Answer:** Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google. It's a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. Unlike AngularJS which uses JavaScript, Angular is built on TypeScript and offers improved performance, a component-based architecture, and better tooling.

**2. Explain what components are in Angular.**
   - **Answer:** Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. Each component consists of an HTML template that declares how that component renders, a TypeScript class that defines behavior, and a CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template. Components are essentially elements of the UI.

**3. What are services in Angular and how are they used?**
   - **Answer:** Services in Angular are singleton objects that provide a method to keep data throughout the life of an application. They contain methods that maintain data and logic. Services are typically used for data sharing, implementing application logic, and interacting with external resources (like web services).

**4. Can you explain data binding in Angular?**
   - **Answer:** Data binding is a core concept in Angular that allows the communication between a component and its DOM, making it easy to synchronize the two. There are four types of data binding: Interpolation ({{ }}), Property Binding ([ ]), Event Binding (( )), and Two-Way Data Binding ([()]).

**5. What is a directive in Angular and can you name a few types?**
   - **Answer:** Directives in Angular are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. There are three main types: Components (directives with a template), Structural directives (change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements, like *ngFor and *ngIf), and Attribute directives (change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive, like ngStyle).

These questions are intended to test foundational knowledge in Angular without going too deep into complex topics.
