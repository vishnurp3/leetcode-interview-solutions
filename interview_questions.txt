Of course, Vishnu! Here are five questions to assess someone's knowledge of Spring Boot:

1. **What is Spring Boot and how does it differ from the Spring framework?**
   - Spring Boot is a module of Spring that provides rapid application development features to the Spring framework, like auto-configuration and standalone application capabilities, making it easier to create production-grade Spring-based applications.

2. **Can you explain the concept of auto-configuration in Spring Boot?**

4. **How does Spring Boot handle database migrations or schema management?**
   - Spring Boot can integrate with tools like Liquibase or Flyway for database migrations and schema management, automating the process of database schema updates.

5. **What are Actuators in Spring Boot and what is their purpose?**
   - Actuators in Spring Boot are used to expose operational information about the running application â€“ health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. They are mainly used for monitoring and management of the application.
