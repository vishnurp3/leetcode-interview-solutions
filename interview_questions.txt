2. **Candidate's Self-Introduction:**
   Ask the candidate to introduce themselves. This allows them to present themselves in their own words.

   _Example:_ "Could you start by telling me a little about yourself and your professional journey so far?"

   - "In your last role, what kind of team were you a part of, and what was your specific contribution?"
   - "Have you worked on any projects that involved [specific technology or methodology relevant to the role they're applying for]?"

4. **Gauging Interest in Current Role:**
   Understand their motivation for applying and their knowledge about your company.

   _Example Questions:_
